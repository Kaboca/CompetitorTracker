== WARNING: This is not an official TradeSkillMaster module==

== TradeSkillMaster_CompetitorTracker ==
This is a module for [[http://www.curse.com/addons/wow/tradeskill-master|TradeSkillMaster]] that reports when WoW Auction House Competitors are online/offline and also saves this data for all characters on the same realm and faction.

If enabled the sync feature and then you add or remove someone from your friends list and relog to an alt, 
that person will be added/removed from the alt's friends list as well. Also, any entries on that alt's
list which isn't in the global list, will be added to the other characters whenever you log them in.

If you do not want to synchronize/track everyone on your friendlist:
* enable the **Track only with mark** option, 
* and set  a desirable text - something like: auctioneer - to the **Track Mark** field, 
* then you can tag (mark)  every competitor in your friend list friend note with the text in the **Track Mark** field,
 so the addon will only track the tagged/marked persons. I use it to track my auction house competition, while playing on alts.


==== How to get it to work ====
* Because this is a TradeSkillMaster module, you need to install TradeSkillMaster main module from here 
(http://www.curse.com/addons/wow/tradeskill-master). 
* Enable the competitor tracker module in the options.
* To access the options simply type "/tsm" and then click on the Competitor Tracker icon in the top right.
