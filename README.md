TradeSkillMaster_CompetitorTracker
==================================

== WARNING: This is not an official TradeSkillMaster module==

== TradeSkillMaster_CompetitorTracker ==
This is a module for [[http://www.curse.com/addons/wow/tradeskill-master|TradeSkillMaster]] that reports when WoW Auction House Competitors are online/offline and also saves this data for all characters on the same realm and faction.

If enabled the sync feature and then you add or remove someone from your friends list and relog to an alt, 
that person will be added/removed from the alts friends list as well. Also, any entries on that alts
list which isn't in the global list, will be added to the other characters whenever you log them in.

I use it to track my auction house competition, while playing on alts.


==== How to get it to work ====
First, because this is a TradeSkillMaster module, you need to install TradeSkillMaster main module from here 
(http://www.curse.com/addons/wow/tradeskill-master). 

===== Command Line =====
* /TSM help
* /TSM ctrack - Enables/ Disables the competitor tracker module.

To access the options simply type "/tsm" and click on Competitor Tracker icon in the top right.
